This BOT is written in Python and uses web scraping and object oriented programming(OOP) to find user's actual internet speed and post in on Twitter.
It scrapes information from https://www.speedtest.net and saves it as a variable of the object within the class. 
Next, it logs to user's twitter account and place a note about current internet speed.
